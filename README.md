If you want to make the button that redirect to next question to be disabled if there is no answer, add 'disabled={ givenAnswers[page] ? false : true}' on line 97 in Question.js. Its not implemented because there are no products that match all the questions simultaneously from the given url 'https://jeval.com.au/collections/hair-care/products.json?page=1'. There is another url 'https://jeval.com.au/collections/hair-care/products.json?page=2', but this url is not given in figma as endpoint.
